Follow the guide at https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-static on how to setup Github actions to setup pages and to automatically build it each time you push. 

I would suggest swapping to cloudflare for domain registration cause its cheaper, and has better analytics. At that point you should use cloudflare pages so you can build from a private github repo.

Still missing mobile support and some animations. Main point is I rebuilt it with grids.
